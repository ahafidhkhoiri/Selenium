# C# Automation test

## Introduction

Using a combination of both the Selenium and C# automation tools allows us to write fast tests that can automate both the browser and the screen.

__Selenium__ is a _browser_ automation tool that can perform actions such as clicking and typing on a browser element if given a css selector of a browser element.

__C#__ is a programming language developed by Microsoft that runs on the .NET Framework. C# is used to develop web apps, desktop apps, mobile apps.

__NUnit__ is a test runner for C# that can run a series of test cases and give easy-to-interpret results.
